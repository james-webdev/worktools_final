          <p className="mt-5">
            When we share personal data, we do so in accordance with Data Protection Law. We may
            share certain personal data, where necessary, with employees, contractors, consultants
            or advisers, to facilitate sales and for general commercial purposes. In addition, where
            necessary, your personal data may be shared: with parties who provide products or
            services to us, such as software development, user analytics, email services, payment
            processing, advertising, user notification and feedback functionality, delivery
            couriers, marketing companies who help us manage our communications with you, data
            insight companies etc. with government or quasi-governmental organisations, law
            enforcement and other regulatory authorities or third parties when required or permitted
            by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders, for the prevention and
            detection of crime and to protect intellectual property and any other legal rights. if
            the company or business is sold, transferred or integrated with another business, with
            our advisers, a prospective purchaser, a prospective purchaser’s advisers or the new
            owner of the company or business to facilitate the process. We may also provide third
            parties with aggregated but anonymised information and analytics about our customers.
            Before we do so we will make sure that it does not identify you. In some cases, when we
            share personal data, it will involve the transfer of that personal data to countries
            outside the EEA which have different data protection standards to those which apply in
            the EEA. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA we will ensure that there are
            adequate safeguards to protect your privacy rights under Data Protection Law.

            responsible for and do not review or endorse the privacy policies or practices of other
            sites which you choose to access from this Site. We encourage you to review the privacy

          <h1 className="mt-8">YOUR RIGHTS</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            We respect your rights to privacy and will respond to requests for access or control
            over information about you in accordance with Data Protection Law. We may require you to
            verify your identity before we take any action. Depending on the reason we have your
            personal data, you have a right to: access the personal information we hold about you
            commonly known as subject access; request that we correct or complete personal
            information we hold about you that is inaccurate or incomplete; request that we erase
            your personal information in some circumstances, or object to our processing it;
            restrict how we use your personal information, in certain circumstances; request that we
            provide you with copies of your personal information in a machine-readable format or
            transfer it across different services; and where we have asked for your consent to
            process your data, to withdraw this consent. These rights are limited in some situations
            under Data Protection Law – for example, where we can demonstrate that we are under a
            legal obligation to process your data. If you wish to exercise any of these rights,
            please contact us using the details in paragraph 2 above.
          </p>

          <h1 className="mt-8">YOUR RIGHT TO OBJECT</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            You have a right to object to our processing of your personal data and ask us to stop
            doing so. If we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes (which
            includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing) and you
            object to this, we will stop processing your personal data immediately. If our
            processing of your personal data including any profiling activities is in the public
            interest or pursuant to our legitimate interests and you object to this, we will stop
            processing your personal data unless we have compelling reasons which override your
            interests, or our use of your personal data is for the establishment, exercise or
            defence of legal claims. We hope that we can satisfy any queries you may have about the
            way we process your data. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the
            right to complain to data protection authorities (in the UK, the Information
            Commissioner’s Office). You can call the ICO on 0303 123 1113 or go to their website:
            https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/).

          <h1 className="mt-8">DATA RETENTION</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            Your personal data will only be kept for as long as necessary for our purposes. Specific
            periods are set out in the table at the end of this policy.
          </p>

          <h1 className="mt-8">DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            We process your personal data in accordance with the following principles: we process
            your personal data lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way; we collect your personal
            data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes; any further processing we do is
            compatible with the original purposes for which for which we collected it; we only
            process personal data which is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary to
            achieve the purpose for which it is processed; we take reasonable steps to ensure that
            all personal data is accurate and kept up to date where necessary; we do not store
            personal data in a form which identifies you for any longer than is necessary for the
            purposes of processing; and we process personal data securely and in a way that protects
            against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage.
            When we ask for your personal data we will tell you whether you are required by law or
            contract to provide it, and what will happen if you do not provide the data. Any request
            for consent to the processing of your personal data will be made directly to you and
            will include information about why we require the personal data and what will be done
            with it.
          </p>

          <h1 className="mt-8">WHAT IS OUR LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING?</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            We will only process personal data when we have a lawful basis for doing that
            processing. The table at the end of this policy sets out the lawful basis we rely on for
            each type of data we process. We will choose one of the lawful bases in the GDPR to
            justify how we use your personal data. These are: Consent: You have given consent to the
            processing of your personal data for one or more specific purposes. Contract: The
            processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or in order to take
            steps at your request before entering into a contract. Legal obligation: We need to
            process your personal data to comply with a legal obligation. Vital interests: The
            processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person. Public
            interest: Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the
            public interest or in the exercise of some official authority. Legitimate interests:
            Processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by us or
            someone else, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or
            fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.
