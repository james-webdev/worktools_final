          <h1 className="mt-8">BACKGROUND</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            These Terms and Conditions explain the basis under which the Service Provider will
            provide the Services to the Client for the price as described below. The Client should
            read these Terms and Conditions carefully to make sure that they understand what is
            agreed.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">DEFINITIONS</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            In these Terms and Conditions, the following words and phrases have the following
            meanings: ‘Client’ – the person or company buying the Services ‘Confirmation of
            Acceptance’ – the Service Provider’s confirmation that the Client’s order has been
            accepted and a binding agreement has been formed for the supply of the Services
            ‘Parties’ – the Client and the Service Provider ‘Party’ – either one of the Client or
            the Service Provider ‘Service Provider’ – the person or company selling the Services;
            contact details at the end of these Terms and Conditions ‘Services’ – the services that
            the Client is purchasing ‘Terms and Conditions’ – this document detailing the rights and
            responsibilities of the Parties
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">SERVICES</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            The Service Provider is under a legal duty to supply the Services using reasonable care
            and skill. The Services will be performed so far as reasonably practicable, at such time
            or times as the Service Provider shall decide. Any times, dates or periods given by the
            Service Provider for provision of the Services are estimates only. The Service Provider
            will make reasonable efforts to comply with any such time estimates, and will perform
            the Services within a reasonable time. However, time is not of the essence in respect of
            the Service Provider’s performance of the Services.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">ORDERING</h1>
          <p>
            By ordering Services from the Service Provider, the Client makes an offer to buy the
            Services for the price given by the Service Provider. There is no binding contract
            between the Parties at the time when the order is made. The Service Provider will
            contact the Client by email to confirm the order. This Confirmation of Acceptance is the
            Service Provider’s acceptance of the order made by the Client. When the Confirmation of
            Acceptance is received, there will be a binding contract between the Parties in
            accordance with these Terms and Conditions. The binding contract will only be for the
            Services that are included in the Confirmation of Acceptance.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">PRICE AND PAYMENT</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            The Client must make payments in accordance with any schedule agreed with the Service
            Provider. VAT will be charged at the rate prevailing at the time that payment is due.
            Where an estimate of the total price has been provided by the Service Provider, the
            final price for the Services may be higher or lower than the estimate. Circumstances
            where the price may be different from an estimate include, but are not limited to: the
            Services taking longer to complete than could have reasonably been anticipated; the
            Client making any changes to the Services after the price is agreed; or changes to the
            prices charged by any of the Service Provider’s suppliers. Without prejudice to any
            other legal right or remedy: if any agreed payment is not received by the Service
            Provider by the due date, they can charge interest on the outstanding sum or sums.
            Interest will be charged at 5% per annum above the Bank of England base rate, accruing
            daily from the due date until payment is made; if the amounts not paid to the Service
            Provider when due total 10% or more of the total value of the Services, the Service
            Provider is entitled to suspend the performance of any remaining Services until the
            outstanding payments are made; and the Client will not refuse to pay any amount which is
            owed to the Service Provider where there is only a minor or inconsequential defect or
            error in the performance of the Services.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">CLIENT’S RESPONSIBILITIES</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            The Client shall co-operate fully with the Service Provider in the performance of the
            Services. Co-operation shall include, but is not limited to: responding promptly and
            properly to any correspondence, request, query or communication from or on behalf of the
            Service Provider; promptly providing any information, documentation, instruction,
            support or other assistance as the Service Provider reasonably requires; promptly making
            any space, resources or facilities available as may reasonably be required by the
            Service Provider; and paying any and all sums due on time. If the Client does not comply
            fully and properly with their responsibilities under this clause, the Service Provider
            may, without prejudice to their legal rights: charge the Client for any costs or
            expenses thereby reasonably incurred; or suspend the provision of the Services until
            such time as the Client complies, so far as reasonably practicable, with their
            responsibilities under these Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">AGENCY OR PARTNERSHIP</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            Nothing in these Terms and Conditions is intended to or does imply any partnership,
            fiduciary relationship, joint venture, agency or any other relationship between the
            Parties, save as provided for in these Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">SUB-CONTRACTORS</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            The Service Provider can, at its absolute discretion, choose to retain or instruct
            sub-contractors to carry out the Services in whole or part.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            Nothing in these Terms and Conditions seeks to limit the liability of the Service
            Provider for fraudulent acts or omissions, death or personal injury caused in connection
            with the provision of the Services, whether arising in contract, negligence, tort,
            breach of statutory duty or otherwise. Neither Party shall be liable to the other
            whether in contract, negligence, tort, breach of statutory duty or otherwise for any
            loss or damage sustained by the other Party indirectly or consequentially and including
            but not limited to economic loss or loss of profits, goodwill or business in general.
            Subject to the rest of this clause, the Service Provider’s total liability to the Client
            will not, in any circumstances, exceed the total amount of the price payable by the
            Client. In the event that the Client or their servants or agents breach these Terms and
            Conditions, or are negligent in their actions, the Client will, to the fullest extent
            permitted by law, indemnify the Service Provider against any liability, loss, claim,
            damage, expense suffered by the Service Provider as a result.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">PROPERTY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            Any property or intellectual property rights in any material owned by the Service
            Provider shall belong to the Service Provider and the Client shall not cause or permit
            anything to endanger those rights or title, or permit, assist or encourage others to do
            so. Any property or intellectual property rights in any material owned by the Client
            shall belong to the Client and the Service Provider shall not cause or permit anything
            to endanger those rights or title, or permit, assist or encourage others to do so. This
            clause is subject to the right of the Parties to use any such material so far as is
            reasonably required to carry out the agreed Services. The Client warrants that any
            material, whether comprising documents, data, records or any other materials, that it
            provides to the Service Provider does not infringe the intellectual property rights of
            any non-Party. The Client agrees to indemnify the Service Provider against any loss,
            damage, cost, expense or claim of any kind that may arise as a result of such an
            infringement.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">CONFIDENTIALITY</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            The Parties will use their best endeavours to keep confidential any confidential
            information relating to the other Party that is provided or otherwise accessed in the
            performance of the Services. Neither Party shall disclose any confidential information
            without the consent of the other Party, except to comply with an order of a court of
            competent jurisdiction or if required in connection with legal proceedings relating to
            these Terms and Conditions. The Parties’ obligations under this clause shall continue
            after the termination or completion of the Services unless or until the information
            concerned becomes public knowledge or is otherwise in the public domain through no fault
            of the Party bound to keep it confidential under this clause.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">AMENDMENT AND TRANSFER OF RIGHTS</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            These Terms and Conditions can only be amended by the agreement of the Parties in
            writing with signatures on behalf of both. The Service Provider is permitted to assign
            or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions, or subcontract
            the same for performance to a third party. The Client is not permitted to assign or
            transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without the prior
            written permission of the Service Provider.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">SEVERANCE</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            If any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions are unlawful, invalid or
            otherwise unenforceable, they will be severed from the remainder. The Terms and
            Conditions which are left will remain valid and enforceable.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">THIRD PARTIES</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            For the purposes of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, these Terms and
            Conditions are not intended to and do not confer any rights on any person who is not a
            Party. Any person who is not a Party does not have the right to enforce any provision of
            these Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE PARTIES</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            The Service Provider shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any term or
            part of these Terms and Conditions due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of
            the Service Provider. Such circumstances include – but are not limited to – industrial
            action, lock out, trade dispute, power failure, internet outage, fire, natural disaster
            or outbreak of war. As soon as is reasonably possible after the discovery of such
            circumstances, the Service Provider will notify the Client in writing of any anticipated
            or existing delay or failure in performance. If the circumstances referred to in this
            clause continue for a period of longer than 30 days, the Service Provider can end the
            contract by giving 30 days’ notice in writing to the Client. All money owing under these
            Terms and Conditions before the circumstances arose shall be paid immediately.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            These Terms and Conditions and the Confirmation of Acceptance taken together are the
            entire agreement between the Service Provider and the Client and supersede any and all
            prior terms, conditions, warranties or representations to the fullest extent permitted
            by law.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mt-8">WAIVER</h1>
          <p className="mt-5">
            Any failure or delay by the Service Provider in using rights or powers provided by these
            Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of the whole or any part of these
            Terms and Conditions. The partial or sole use of any rights or powers provided by these
            Terms and Conditions shall not prevent any additional use of the same rights or powers.
            The rights, powers and remedies in these Terms and Conditions are additional to the
            rights of the Parties provided by law.
